      "In January 1672, Isaac Newton had just turned 29 and had been aware of the importance of King Charles II for all his adult life."
    , "For King Charles, on the other hand, Isaac Newton was of no particular importance. He may have heard that this young man had become a professor of mathematics at Cambridge, because he, King Charles, had officially established that position eight years earlier. But there were many bright young man from rich families who had money and time to spend cultivating their minds, and the king in his enlightenment was keen to encourage inquisitiveness in all of them."
    , "However, in January 1672, what attracted King Charles's attention was not Newton's mind but something that he had made with his hands. A telescope, a tube about 18 centimetres long and 6 cm in diameter, mounted on a ball and socket so that it could swivel in any direction. And what was amazing about this telescope was that it magnified objects as well as traditional telescopes 10 times as long."
    , "Something that Newton had made with his hands."
    , "In particular, a concave mirror, curved like the inside of a sphere."

      "The idea was not new. Other bright young men — Gallileo's friend Bonaventura Cavalieri, as early as 1632; Marin Mersenne (famous for his primes); a certain Cassegrain from Chartres, whose identity has since slipped through the cracks of time; and the Scot James Gregory — had all come up with similar ideas, but they had not been able to make a concave mirror with sufficient precision and reflectivity. In 1663, James Gregory had gone so far as to pay Richard Reeve, a professional glass grinder in London, to make a concave mirror for him, but this proved \"unsatisfactory\" and was never assembled into a telescope, and besides, Gregory was in a hurry to travel on to the university of Padua in Italy, and so the experiment was abandoned."
    , "And so it was Isaac Newton, with no formal training as a glass grinder, who made the first concave mirror of any value. He faced three major problems. First, there were no tools yet, and no techniques, for grinding glass into a concave shape, so all the work had to be done by hand; and second, no-one had ever tried to measure the surface of a piece of glass to see how closely it matched the curvature of a sphere. Isaac Newton had a mind keen enough to find solutions to these two problems."

    "But the third problem was both mindless and unavoidable. It takes something like a hundred hours of physical labour to grind such a mirror. And it is tedious and dirty work. You start with two circular blocks of glass and rub the centre of one against the edge of the other, using random strokes and grit. At first you want grit like coarse sand that scratches the glass, so that each stroke has the maximum effect of hollowing one block and wearing down the edges of the other. The grit gradually breaks down into finer sand, into silt, into wet dust that stains your clothes and your hair, gets under your finger nails, buries itself into your skin. So you keep rubbing the two glass discs randomly against each other, knowing that the only way they can touch at every point for any random position is if they are both flat or both spherical: one concave and one convex. It's natural, when you think about it."  
   , "You want the final result to be smooth and shiny, and precise to within a few nanometres, so you use finer and finer grit, but you must make sure that all the coarser grit is gone, so that it will not leave any scratch marks. You must clean your clothes, your hair, your hands, your fingernails, time and time over. The same movements, the same pressure on your muscles, over and over. The same noise of scraping, hour after hour after hour."

    "When Isaac Newton did this, he was the first. He did not know how long it would take, or even i fit would be successful. He did not leave a record of his efforts. He probably did not speak to anyone for days."
  , "He made the tube for his telescope much more quickly, out of cardboard."
  , "When King Charles II looked into Isaac Newton's telescope, he did not need to know anything of all that brutal physical effort. All he needed was to see the result: the magnifying power of this surprising small gadget. He did not even need to see Isaac Newton in person, or to give him back his creation. The telescope stayed in the collection of his Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge, hardly used and slowly disintegrating. By 1731, all that was left of it were the two mirrors. And what became of them after that, no-one knows."
